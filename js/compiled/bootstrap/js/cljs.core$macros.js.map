Docs can be specified for the\n  protocol overall and for each method. The above yields a set of\n  polymorphic functions and a protocol object. All are\n  namespace-qualified by the ns enclosing the definition The resulting\n  functions dispatch on the type of their first argument, which is\n  required and corresponds to the implicit target object ('this' in\n  JavaScript parlance). defprotocol is dynamic, has no special compile-time\n  effect, and defines no new types.\n\n  (defprotocol P\n    (foo [this])\n    (bar-me [this] [this y]))\n\n  (deftype Foo [a b c]\n    P\n    (foo [this] a)\n    (bar-me [this] b)\n    (bar-me [this y] (+ c y)))\n\n  (bar-me (Foo. 1 2 3) 42)\n  => 45\n\n  (foo\n    (let [x 42]\n      (reify P\n        (foo [this] 17)\n        (bar-me [this] x)\n        (bar-me [this y] x))))\n  => 17\"\n  [psym & doc+methods]\n  (core/let [p (:name (cljs.analyzer/resolve-var (dissoc &env :locals) psym))\n             [opts methods]\n             (core/loop [opts {:protocol-symbol true}\n                         methods []\n                         sigs doc+methods]\n               (core/if-not (seq sigs)\n                 [opts methods]\n                 (core/let [[head & tail] sigs]\n                   (core/cond\n                     (core/string? head)\n                     (recur (assoc opts :doc head) methods tail)\n                     (core/keyword? head)\n                     (recur (assoc opts head (first tail)) methods (rest tail))\n                     (core/list? head)\n                     (recur opts (conj methods head) tail)\n                     :else\n                     (throw #?(:clj  (Exception.\n                                       (core/str \"Invalid protocol, \" psym \" received unexpected argument\"))\n                               :cljs (js/Error.\n                                       (core/str \"Invalid protocol, \" psym \" received unexpected argument\"))))\n                     ))))\n             psym (vary-meta psym merge opts)\n             ns-name (core/-> &env :ns :name)\n             fqn (core/fn [n] (symbol (core/str ns-name) (core/str n)))\n             prefix (protocol-prefix p)\n             _ (core/doseq [[mname & arities] methods]\n                 (core/when (some #{0} (map count (filter vector? arities)))\n                   (throw\n                     #?(:clj (Exception.\n                               (core/str \"Invalid protocol, \" psym\n                                 \" defines method \" mname \" with arity 0\"))\n                        :cljs (js/Error.\n                                (core/str \"Invalid protocol, \" psym\n                                  \" defines method \" mname \" with arity 0\"))))))\n             expand-sig (core/fn [fname slot sig]\n                          (core/let [sig (core/if-not (every? core/symbol? sig)\n                                           (mapv (core/fn [arg]\n                                                   (core/cond\n                                                     (core/symbol? arg) arg\n                                                     (core/and (map? arg) (core/some?
